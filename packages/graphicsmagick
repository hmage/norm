--without-x   ## graphicsmagick is used most as library and command-line tool, GUI is not needed, if you need it, open an issue
--without-ttf ## don't build freetype and it's dependencies for a rarely used feature, but if you need it, open an issue
--without-trio ## trio contains portable printf functions, we don't really need that
--without-jxl  ## opportunistic linking, also jpeg-xl is broken in graphicsmagick because jxl changed their API
--without-zstd ## opportunistic linking, not main functionality
